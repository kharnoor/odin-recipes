    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class = "description" id = "cg">Chocolate ganache is a mixture of cream and chocolate that has lots of uses with homemade baked goods. 
            Perfect for cakes, truffles, and pastries, this deliciously rich topping can be used as a filling, frosting, or glaze.</p>
        <p class = "description" id = "cg">Ganache was reportedly created in 1869 by Parisian playwright and confectioner Paul Siraudin, 
            who is said to have named it after a popular Vaudevillian comedy called Les Ganaches.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class = "i" id = "cg">
                <li>9 ounces bittersweet chocolate, roughly chopped (or chocolate chips)</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol id = "cg">
                <li>Place chocolate in a medium mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Heat cream in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring just to a boil, watching very carefully because if it boils for even a few seconds, it will boil out of the pot.</li>
                <li>As soon as the cream comes to a boil, pour it over the chocolate in the mixing bowl. Whisk until chocolate has melted and mixture is smooth. </li>
                <li>Stir the ganache until the cream and the chocolate are fully combined.</li>
            </ol>
